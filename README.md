This is a slash command package I built when I was bored.
It includes slash commands and optional prefix commands.

# Guide on setting it up:
- Download ZIP from https://github.com/iLikeToCode/SlashCommandPackage.git
    - Unzip the ZIP file.
    - Open the extracted folder in a terminal
- Type npm i, I have included a package.json and package-lock.json for easy package install.
- Open example.env
    - Rename example.env to .env
    - Fill in all the values, prefix is optional, if it is not provided, the prefix module is disabled.
